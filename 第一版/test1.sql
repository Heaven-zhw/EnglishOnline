（in）doing…做…有困难，这是疑问句，用any，some用于陈述句和肯定句，句意：你完成这个工作有困难吗？--这个工作不向你想象的那么难。我们已经完成了。选B。<br/>考点：考查代词<br/>点评：代词首先要弄清它指代的是什么，指代的数量，结合句意和代词本身的用法，再进行辨析。Some和any的区别主要看句式，以及肯定和否定的用法，再选择适当的代词。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(104,116,'<p>______

surprised the hostess most，并在从句作主语。That引导表语从句，that one of her friends left the party without saying a word.这个表语从句很完整，that只起引导作用，不充当任何成分。结合句意可知B正确。句意：让女主人惊讶的是其中一个朋友什么也没说就离开聚会。<br/>考点：考查主语从句和表语从句<br/>点评：主语从句和表语从句是在复合句中充当主语',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(105,117,'<p>Some people get in touch with each other by

was+一段时间+before…，要多久…就（才）…，在考试中出现的很多，容易混淆的句型是it is/has been 一段时间since从句（过去时）；自从…以来，已经有一段时间了。区分的时候，一是从句意判断，还有就是根据主句的时态区分。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(107,121,'<p>I don\'t like talking on _______ telephone;

telephone；要用定冠词;letters是复数形式,表示泛指,\"写信\"不用冠词.第二空是一类事物的表达法，可以使用“a/an/the+单数名词”“名词复数形式”。故B正确。<br/>考点：考察冠词<br/>点评：冠词的考查集中在定冠词the表示特指，不定冠词a/an表示泛指；以及冠词的一些特殊用法和固定词组，还有一些不使用冠词的情况，如抽象名词，物质名词前面就不要冠词。还要掌握冠词的特殊的用法，如不可数名词变成可数名词；抽象名',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(108,122,'<p>

other两者中的另外一个。Neither两者都不。故B正确。<br/>考点：考察代词<br/>点评：此题型主要考察不定代词的种类和用法，本题中出现了不定代词和特殊疑问代词，命题者出题时通常挑选几种不同类的代词作为选项，以此考察考生对代词本身的用法掌握和在具体语言环境下对代词的正确使用。考生在复习时，应着重对代词进行归纳整理并且平时注意</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(109,124,'<p>Boris

class与Boris相比较,要用比较级.当比较级后有名词时,要加冠词.the higher IQ(两人中)比较高的智商,不能作为答案.句意：Boris很有头脑。我怀疑在班级里是否有谁比他的更高的智商。故B正确。<br/>考点：考察形容词用法<br/>点评：形容词比较级中的一个特殊用法就是与否定词连用表示最高级的含义，在具体考察的时候要注意所使用的形容词的词义选择。<',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(110,123,'<p>We don\'t care if a hunting dog smells _______, but we really don\'t want him to smell _______.</p>','well; well','bad; bad ','well; badly ','badly; bad','C','<i>试题分析：考察形容词副词用法。 smell作系动词后接形容词;作行为动词后接副词.这个句子中的两个smells都是行为动词,意思是\"嗅\".我们不在乎猎狗的嗅觉是否灵敏,但我们真地不希望它的嗅觉迟钝.故C正确。<br/>考点：考察形容词副词用法<br/>点评：形容词副词用法中要特别注意，形容词通常都放在系动词后面构成系表结构；而副词通常做状语放在动词后。在具体的句中要辨别清楚动词的具体词性。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(111,125,'<p>When a pencil is partly in a glass of water, it looks as if it _______.</p>','breaks ','has broken','were broken ','had been broken','C','<i>试题分析：考察虚拟语气。 as if引导的从句如果表示的是虚假的事情，则常用虚拟语气.表示现在用一般过去时,如果是动词be,无论主语是单数还是复数一律用were.表示过去用过去完成时;表示将来用过去将来时.句意：当一支铅笔的一部分放在水杯里，看起来好像铅笔是断的。根据句意可知实际上铅笔并没有断。这是一个虚假的事情，且这是一个与现在事实相反的虚拟语气，故使用were。故C正确。<br/>考点：考察虚拟语气<br/>点评：要注意as

_______ is just around the corner and you won\'t miss it.</p>','bicycle\'s shop ','bicycle shop','bicycles shop ','bicycles\' shop','B','<i>试题分析：考察名词作定语。名词作定语的时候通常使用单数形式的名词修饰名词，如shoe shop鞋店。表示什么样的商店要用单数名词修饰shop.自行车商店就在拐角处,你不会错过它.故B正确。<br/>考点：考察名词作定语<br/>点评：名词作定语的时候，通常使用单数形式，如boy friend等。但是也有一些名词要使用复数形式做定语，如sales man；等等。对于这样的一些特殊用法，在平时要多加积累。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(114,131,'<p>As

指代可数名词单数，表示泛指；其特质形式为the one。It指代上文出现的同一事物；that指代可数名词单数，或者不可数名词，后面必须有定语修饰。起复数形式为those，',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(115,134,'<p>_______ people in the world are sending information by e-mail every

of.句意：世界上好几百万人每天都通过电子邮件发送信息。故A正确。<br/>考点：考察数词用法<br/>点评：通常在hundred，million等单位名词如果有确定的数字时，后面的单位名词使用单数形式。Several的用法也是一样。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,136,'<p>I wonder how he _______ that to the teacher.</p>','dare to say ','dare saying','not dare say ','dared say','D','<i>试题分析：考察情态动词。 dare是情态动词,它的过去式是 dared,后接动词原形.dared作行为动词时,要用dare to do sth.,行为动词有数的变化,这句话的主语是he,其谓语的正确形式应该是dares to say.故D正确。<br/>考点：考察情态动词<br/>点评：情态动词就是表示说话者对事情的一种看法，也就是一种语气。情态动词的用法一直是命题者常设置的考点和重点，平时要加强记忆。值的注意的是，中学阶段的情态动词常考额有13个，can-could； may-might； sho',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(117,138,'<p>John may phone tonight.I

可引导时间状语,意思是\"一……就……\".句意：—你记得要把欠的钱给Mary吗？-是的。我一见到她就给了她。根据句意说明B正确。<br/>考点：考察名词短语作连词<br/>点评：在英语中，经常会用一些表示时间的名词短语引导时间状语从句，这些名词从语法意义上，已经充当连词来引导从句，常见到名词短语有：1.the moment, the minute, the instant, the second等，这',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(119,140,'<p>If you want help — money or anything, let me know, _______ you </p>','don\'t ','will','shall ','do','B','<i>试题分析：考察反义疑问句的固定句式。 let me know是祈使句,反意疑问句要用will you.句意：如果你需要帮助，钱或者其他的任何东西，让我知道，好吗？故B正确。<br/>考点：考察固定句式<br/>点评：在高中的学习中平时要多积累固定句式的用法，考试时只能凭借记忆力来答题，尤其是单项选择很难推出某个句式的意思，所以平时的积累记忆是尤其重要的。学生可以将常考的全部积累在一起，通过反复的复习，从而达到永久的记忆下来。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(120,141,'<p>I

weather it is是一个让步状语从句。Whatever后面引导的是名词或者代词。However后面接的是形容词或者副词。句意：无论是什么天气，我们都会准时出发。B项不符合语法，CD两项与上下文的含义不相符。故A正确。<br/>考点：考察让步状语从句<br/>点评：本题的让步状语从句考察的是“No matter+特殊',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(124,145,'<p>______ it rain heavily tomorrow, we would have to put off the visit to the Forbidden

;should+动词原形，主句使用“情态动词+动词原形”；要特别注意如果省略了if，句子要使用部分倒装的形式，把助动词，be动词，情态动词提之主语前。本题就是把if省略，把should提前。句意：如果明天的雨下得很大，我们就不得不不推迟到紫禁城的参观。故B正确。<br/>考点：条件句中的虚拟语气<br/>点评：条件句的虚拟语气是考查的重点。如果过去事实相反，条件句中使用过去完成时，主句使',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(125,146,'<p>Kate

The United States ranked 28th out of 41 countries tested. After all, when was the last time you used algebra (代数)？<br/>But maths isn’t just about training Americans to become scientists. It has its own value. It helps you see patterns and develops your logic skills, and it teaches you to concentrate and to separate truth from falsehood. Maths helps you make wise financial decisions, so you can avoid false claims from advertisers, politicians and others. It helps you determine risk. For example, after an airplane crash, studies show that people are more likely to drive than to take a plane in spite of the fact that they are much more likely to be killed or injured while driving. Planes are not like criminals who repeat the same crime over and over. One plane is not more likely to crash just because another plane recently did. In fact, the most dangerous time to drive is probably right after a plane crash because so many people are on the road. <br/>It is not possible to really understand science and the scientific method without understanding maths. A rainbow is even more beautiful and amazing when we understand it.<br/>The precision (精确性) of maths helps us think in a very special way. How do we bring the learning of maths back to life? I don’t have the big answer. I try my best to help pupils find answers to some maths problems.

Compare your pronunciation with the master version, see how you can do better and have another go. If you do this several times, you will find that each version is better than the last.<br/>Why not learn with someone else?<br/>It helps if you can learn with someone else. If you can persuade a friend or a family member to study with you, it will make you keep working.<br/>Don’t get stuck by a word you don’t know.<br/>Practise improvising（即兴的）ways of getting your meaning across when speaking spontaneously（本能地）, even if you don’t know the exact words or phrases. Think of things you might want to say whenever you have spare time. Use facial expressions, hand movements, anything to get your meaning across.<br/>Language learning is also about intuition（直觉）.<br/>Guesswork is an important way to learn a new language. When listening to recorded material, you aren’t expected to understand everything first round. If you play the same piece several times, you will most probably understand something new each time.<br/>Build up your vocabulary.<br/>A wide vocabulary is the key to successful language learning but don’t try to learn too much at once. It’s best to study frequently, for short periods of time. Take at most six or seven items of vocabulary and learn them. Put them into sentences to fix them in your mind, then come back to them later.<br/>And above all, have fun!<br/></p>',4,NULL),(30,34,'<p>Parents should stop blaming themselves because there’s not a lot they can do about it.

Its word-learning skills are as good as those of a parrot or chimpanzee.<br/>In one experiment, the researchers took all 200 items that Rico is supposed to know and divided them into 20 groups of 10 objects. Then the owner told the dog to go and fetch one of the items and bring it back. In four tests, Rico got 37 out of 40 commands right. As the dog couldn\'t see anyone to get clues, the scientists believe Rico must understand the meanings of certain words.<br/>In another experiment, the scientists took one toy that Rico had never seen before and put it in a room with seven toys whose names the dog already knew. The owner then told Rico to fetch the object, using a word the dog had never heard before.<br/>The correct object was chosen in seven out of ten tests, suggesting that the dog had worked<br/>out the answer by process of elimination(排除法).

But our findings show that people believe their dreams provide meaningful insight (见识) into themselves and their world,” said a lead author of the study Carey More wedge, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. <br/> In six different studies, researchers surveyed nearly 1,100 people about their dreams. One of the studies focused on general beliefs about dreams and involved 149 university students. All students were asked to rate different theories about dreams. The experts found that a surprising majority of the participants supported the theory about dreams revealing (揭示) the hidden truths about themselves and the rest of the world. <br/> In a second experiment, they surveyed 182 people at a Boston train station, and asked them to imagine one out of four possible situations that could have occurred the night before a scheduled airline trip. Most of the participants said that dreaming of a plane crash would be more likely to affect their travel plans than would just thinking about a crash, or being warned by the government of a terrorism risk. They said a dreamed crash would influence their travel plans just as much as learning about a real crash on their planned route would.<br/> Another experiment involved 270 men and women from across the United States. In a short online survey, they were asked to recall one of the dreams they had seen about any person they knew. The findings showed that people were more likely to remember and describe pleasant dreams about a person they liked, rather than a person they disliked. Meanwhile, in most cases they tended to consider an unpleasant dream as more meaningful if it was about a person they disliked. <br/>“In other words,” said More wedge, “people attribute (归因于) meaning to dreams when it corresponds (与……一致) with their pre-existing beliefs and desires.” The researchers say that more investigation (研究) is needed to fully understand how people interpret their dreams.

It was named after the Klieg brothers who invented the lights. Actors wore sunglasses to give their eyes a rest. But when movie stars began wearing their sunglasses in public, they quickly became a must.<br/>　 Eventually actors started wearing sunglasses in their movies as well as on the street. Audrey Hephburn wore ultra-cool Ray-Ban sunglasses in the 1961 movie, Breakfast at Tiffany’s. As a result, Ray-Ban sunglasses started to appear more and more in the movies. In 1979, Ray-Ban “Wayfarers” were worn by Jake and Elwood in The Blue Brothers. Tom Cruise wore Ray-Ban “Aviator” sunglasses in the 1986 hit, Top Gun. Then in 1997, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made Ray-Ban “Predator” sunglasses famous in Men in Black.<br/>　  Of course sunglasses aren’t just a fashion statement. The main reason to wear sunglasses is to protect our eyes against UV radiation. UV radiation can damage our eyes, so people now choose their sunglasses carefully. But you don’t have to give up style for safety. The choice of frames and lenses available these days is huge. So you can protect your eyes and still be the coolest person on the beach.<br/></p>',4,NULL),(53,60,'<p>Crazy is our new normal.

Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk.<br/>Not only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics. That alone is something that is very rare in teaching type books these days.<br/> Some of the more valuable and informative lessons will take you into the areas of:<br/>--Strings and variables<br/>--Processing HTML forms<br/>--Controlling and filtering data<br/>--User authentication<br/>--Cookies and sessions<br/>--Security practices<br/>--Configuring PHP and more!!!<br/>The book is pretty basic for experienced PHP coders, but for new or intermediate users this book is worth more than the small $19.99 CAN suggested price.

Most doctors in training will be limited to eighty-four hours of work each week. They will have work periods of no more than twenty-four hours at one time. They will have ten hours of rest between work periods.<br/>Medical residents will have one day each week when they do not have to work. Any work they accept outside their hospitals will be limited．Experienced doctors and medical professors will closely supervise the residents to make sure they are not too tired to work.<br/>Many medical residents welcomed the work limits.

Chinese is the language with the most speakers. English, Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people. On the other hand, some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers.<br/>There are several important families of languages in the world.

Think about this analogy. You have a car with a full tank of gas, a well-tuned engine, good set of tires, quadraphonic CD system, and a sleek, polished exterior(外表). There it sits. This car has incredible potential. However, until a driver sits behind the wheel, puts the key in the ignition(点火装置), and cranks it up, the car doesn\'t function.

He spent eight months of his off-hours on demolition(拆除), pulling rubbish out through the roof, because it was too dangerous to go inside the building, The demolition was hard work, but it gave him time to think about what he wanted to do, and “to treasure what was there – the walls, the rust, the light,” Yocum said.” Every season, more paint falls off the walls and more rust develops. It’s like an art installation(装置) in there-a slow-motion show.”<br/>Since the back building had been constructed without windows, an all-glass front was added to the building to give it a view of the courtyard, and skylights were installed in the roof. The back of the building is a working area and a living room for Yocum and his wife.

that','That, what','B','<i>试题分析：考查主语从句和表语从句。What引导主语从句what surprised the hostess most，并在从句作主语。That引导表语从句，that one of her friends left the party without saying a word.这个表语从句很完整，that只起引导作用，不充当任何成分。结合句意可知B正确。句意：让女主人惊讶的是其中一个朋友什么也没说就离开聚会。<br/>考点：考查主语从句和表语从句<br/>点评：主语从句和表语从句是在复合句中充当主语',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(103,117,'<p>Some people get in touch with each other by

will come to the meeting on time, ______?</p>','do I','do you','will she','won’t she','C','<i>试题分析：考查反意问句：前面的句子I don’t think+从句，为否定前移，主句的主语是第一人称，所以反问句的主语要看从句的主语，而且前面是否定后面是肯定，用will she？句意：我想她会准时参加会议，是吗？选C。<br/>考点：考查反意问句<br/>点评：一般情况反意问句是根据主句来做反义问句，但如果主句是否定前移的情况，而且是第一人称，反意问句就和从句保持一致，而且因为是否定前移，反意问句就是肯定。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(105,120,'<p>It won’t be a very long time _________ he

was+一段时间+before…，要多久…就（才）…，在考试中出现的很多，容易混淆的句型是it is/has been 一段时间since从句（过去时）；自从…以来，已经有一段时间了。区分的时候，一是从句意判断，还有就是根据主句的时态区分。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(106,122,'<p> Both teams were in hard training, _______

other两者中的另外一个。Neither两者都不。故B正确。<br/>考点：考察代词<br/>点评：此题型主要考察不定代词的种类和用法，本题中出现了不定代词和特殊疑问代词，命题者出题时通常挑选几种不同类的代词作为选项，以此考察考生对代词本身的用法掌握和在具体语言环境下对代词的正确使用。考生在复习时，应着重对代词进行归纳整理并且平时注意</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(107,121,'<p>I don\'t like talking on _______ telephone; I prefer writing _______ letters.</p>','a; the','the; / ','the; the ','a; /','B','<i>试题分析：考察冠词。本题第一空是固定搭配：“通过电话”on the telephone；要用定冠词;letters是复数形式,表示泛指,\"写信\"不用冠词.第二空是一类事物的表达法，可以使用“a/an/the+单数名词”“名词复数形式”。故B正确。<br/>考点：考察冠词<br/>点评：冠词的考查集中在定冠词the表示特指，不定冠词a/an表示泛指；以及冠词的一些特殊用法和固定词组，还有一些不使用冠词的情况，如抽象名词，物质名词前面就不要冠词。还要掌握冠词的特殊的用法，如不可数名词变成可数名词；抽象名',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(108,115,'<p>The

result.结果，句意：欧洲定居者的到达对当地美洲人的生活有很大影响。选C。<br/>考点：考查名词词义辨析<br/>点评：词汇辨析是每次试卷中必然出现的题型，所以平时一定要把词汇放在句中进行记忆。在复习词汇的时候，要依据语言的横向组合和纵向聚合，按照点-线-面顺序，构建知识网络环境，对知识内容进行巩固、深化和提升，这样才能提高复习知识点的效率。这样，再做单项填空题时，就会觉得游刃有余。对于英语中的词汇用法',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(109,123,'<p>We don\'t care if a hunting dog smells _______, but we really don\'t want him to smell _______.</p>','well; well','bad; bad ','well; badly ','badly; bad','C','<i>试题分析：考察形容词副词用法。 smell作系动词后接形容词;作行为动词后接副词.这个句子中的两个smells都是行为动词,意思是\"嗅\".我们不在乎猎狗的嗅觉是否灵敏,但我们真地不希望它的嗅觉迟钝.故C正确。<br/>考点：考察形容词副词用法<br/>点评：形容词副词用法中要特别注意，形容词通常都放在系动词后面构成系表结构；而副词通常做状语放在动词后。在具体的句中要辨别清楚动词的具体词性。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(110,125,'<p>When a pencil is partly in a glass of water, it looks as if it _______.</p>','breaks ','has broken','were broken ','had been broken','C','<i>试题分析：考察虚拟语气。 as if引导的从句如果表示的是虚假的事情，则常用虚拟语气.表示现在用一般过去时,如果是动词be,无论主语是单数还是复数一律用were.表示过去用过去完成时;表示将来用过去将来时.句意：当一支铅笔的一部分放在水杯里，看起来好像铅笔是断的。根据句意可知实际上铅笔并没有断。这是一个虚假的事情，且这是一个与现在事实相反的虚拟语气，故使用were。故C正确。<br/>考点：考察虚拟语气<br/>点评：要注意as

IQ(两人中)比较高的智商,不能作为答案.句意：Boris很有头脑。我怀疑在班级里是否有谁比他的更高的智商。故B正确。<br/>考点：考察形容词用法<br/>点评：形容词比较级中的一个特殊用法就是与否定词连用表示最高级的含义，在具体考察的时候要注意所使用的形容词的词义选择。<',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(112,127,'<p>----Did you see a child

指代可数名词单数，表示泛指；其特质形式为the one。It指代上文出现的同一事物；that指代可数名词单数，或者不可数名词，后面必须有定语修饰。起复数形式为those，',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(114,134,'<p>_______ people in the world are sending information by e-mail every

of.句意：世界上好几百万人每天都通过电子邮件发送信息。故A正确。<br/>考点：考察数词用法<br/>点评：通常在hundred，million等单位名词如果有确定的数字时，后面的单位名词使用单数形式。Several的用法也是一样。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(115,132,'<p>The _______ is just around the corner and you

shop鞋店。表示什么样的商店要用单数名词修饰shop.自行车商店就在拐角处,你不会错过它.故B正确。<br/>考点：考察名词作定语<br/>点评：名词作定语的时候，通常使用单数形式，如boy friend等。但是也有一些名词要使用复数形式做定语，如sales man；等等。对于这样的一些特殊用法，在平时要多加积累。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,136,'<p>I wonder how he _______ that to the teacher.</p>','dare to say ','dare saying','not dare say ','dared say','D','<i>试题分析：考察情态动词。 dare是情态动词,它的过去式是 dared,后接动词原形.dared作行为动词时,要用dare to do sth.,行为动词有数的变化,这句话的主语是he,其谓语的正确形式应该是dares to say.故D正确。<br/>考点：考察情态动词<br/>点评：情态动词就是表示说话者对事情的一种看法，也就是一种语气。情态动词的用法一直是命题者常设置的考点和重点，平时要加强记忆。值的注意的是，中学阶段的情态动词常考额有13个，can-could； may-might；

可引导时间状语,意思是\"一……就……\".句意：—你记得要把欠的钱给Mary吗？-是的。我一见到她就给了她。根据句意说明B正确。<br/>考点：考察名词短语作连词<br/>点评：在英语中，经常会用一些表示时间的名词短语引导时间状语从句，这些名词从语法意义上，已经充当连词来引导从句，常见到名词短语有：1.the moment, the minute, the instant, the second等，这',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(119,140,'<p>If you want help — money or anything, let me know, _______ you </p>','don\'t ','will','shall ','do','B','<i>试题分析：考察反义疑问句的固定句式。 let me know是祈使句,反意疑问句要用will you.句意：如果你需要帮助，钱或者其他的任何东西，让我知道，好吗？故B正确。<br/>考点：考察固定句式<br/>点评：在高中的学习中平时要多积累固定句式的用法，考试时只能凭借记忆力来答题，尤其是单项选择很难推出某个句式的意思，所以平时的积累记忆是尤其重要的。学生可以将常考的全部积累在一起，通过反复的复习，从而达到永久的记忆下来。</i>',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(120,141,'<p>I

;should+动词原形，主句使用“情态动词+动词原形”；要特别注意如果省略了if，句子要使用部分倒装的形式，把助动词，be动词，情态动词提之主语前。本题就是把if省略，把should提前。句意：如果明天的雨下得很大，我们就不得不不推迟到紫禁城的参观。故B正确。<br/>考点：条件句中的虚拟语气<br/>点评：条件句的虚拟语气是考查的重点。如果过去事实相反，条件句中使用过去完成时，主句使',1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(125,148,'<p>I’m

When they talk to an Indian, he often shakes his head. They might think that the Indian does not like what he said, but <u>on the contrary</u> he is expressing agreement.<br/> The Indians have a habit of shaking their heads slightly when they talk to somebody. It doesn’t mean “No”, but “Yes”. <br/> If a person doesn’t know this, it might cause misunderstanding.<br/> At one time a foreigner in Indian told his driver who was an Indian to take him to his office. The driver shook his head. The foreigner repeated his request and the driver shook his head again. At last, the foreigner shouted angrily, “Drive me to my office at once!” The driver said in a low voice, “Yes, sir,” smiling and shaking his head again at the same time.<br/>',5,2),(2,2,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Even at school there had been an unhealthy competition between George and Richard. <br/>“I’ll be the first millionaire in Coleford!” Richard used to boast. <br/>“And you’ll be sorry that you knew me,” George would reply “because I’ll surely be the best lawyer in our town!” <br/>After graduation, George never became a lawyer and Richard was anybody but a millionaire …. Instead, it happened that both men opened bookshops on opposite sides of Coleford High Street, while it was hard to make much money from books then, which made the competition between them worse. Eventually, Richard closed down his, dreaming of making a fortune elsewhere. <br/>Now, with only one bookshop in the town, business was better for George. But sometimes he sat in his narrow old kitchen and gazed out of the dirty window, thinking about his former rival (竞争对手)。Perhaps he missed him? zxxk<br/>George was very interested in old dictionaries, and he had recently found a collector in Australia who was selling a rare first edition. When the parcel arrived, the book was in perfect condition and George was quite delighted. But while he was having lunch, George glanced at the photo in the newspaper that the book had been wrapped in. He was astonished — the smiling face was older than he remembered but unmistakable! Trembling, George started reading: “Bookends Company has bought ten bookstores from its competitors. The company, owned by multi-millionaire Richard Pike, is now the largest bookseller in this country.” <br/>',5,2),(3,3,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Thomas Alva Edison was awarded more patents on inventions than any other American. When he died in 1931, Americans wondered how they could best show their respect for him. One suggestion was that the nation observe a minute or two of total blackout. All electric power would be shut off in homes, streets, and factories. Perhaps this suggested plan made Americans realize fully what Edison and his inventions mean to them. Electric power was too important to the country. Shutting it off for even a short time would have led to complete confusion. A blackout was impossible.<br/> On the day of Edison\'s funeral, many people silently dimmed their lights. In this way they honored the man who had done more than anyone else to put the great force of electricity at his countrymen\'s fingertips.<br/>',5,2),(4,4,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                It gives me great pleasure today to say a few words in praise of a man we will all miss very much.

But it was raining hard that afternoon and there were few people in the street. When his vegetables were sold out, it was dark. He bought some medicine and hurried to his village.<br/>On his way home he saw a person lying on the snow. He placed his baskets on the ground and was going to help the person to get up.

Having shown the baskets, an officer asked: “Are these yours?” “Yes, sir.” the farmer answered timidly(胆怯地)。”Have you killed the man?” “No, no, sir.” the farmer said in a hurry.” When did you see the dead man?” ”About seven last evening.” “Did you see who killed the man?” “No, Sir.” The officer brought out a knife and asked, “Have you seen it yet?” ”No, Sir.’ The officer became angry and told the policemen to beat him up and send him into prison.<br/>That evening the officer went on trying .Pointing to the knife, he asked again,” Have you seen it yet?” ”Yes, Sir.” The officer was happy and asked,” When and where?” “I saw it here this afternoon, sir.”<br/>',5,2),(8,8,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                The arts, especially music, should be part of every school\'s lessons at every grade level. Students would be much smarter if they had some musical experience. They could improve their classroom skills, like paying attention and following directions. People develop all these skills when they learn music. Making music also lets children use their imagination. It provides students with a chance to try out their own ideas.<br/>Music not only makes children better students, but also gives them something positive to do. In a music program, children can be part of a band instead of joining a gang (团伙). Parents can enjoy listening to their children\'s music instead of seeing them <u>glued to</u> a computer or TV screen. In a school band, students get to be part of a team. They can get along well with old friends and make new friends through music.<br/>Music builds self-confidence, too. It gives children a sense of achievement and success. Making music is something for them to be proud of, and it lets kids practice performing in front of an audience. Music gives children an opportunity for self-expression, and that helps develop their self-confidence.<br/>Once again, music is important because it can make children better students, give them something positive to do, and build their character.

Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.<br/> Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking—the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place\'s natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. <br/> \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It\'s not something you do quickly and then you\'re on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn\'t a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.<br/>\"When you stand below <img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/78/3d/78b3dacde1d042f2f56fac6a6d75ba2b.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael\'s Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree.

A 1979 study of 3,545 London office workers showed that fat people eat less than slim (苗条的) people.<br/>Studies also show that slim people are more active than fat people. A study by a research group at Stanford University found the following interesting facts:<br/>The more the man ran, the greater loss of the body fat.<br/>The more they ran, the greater increase in food intake.<br/>Thus, those who ran the most ate the most, yet lost the greatest amount of body fat.<br/>',5,2),(14,14,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />--><code>Shift Happens by Robert Holden</code><br/><code>Price: $ 6.49</code><br/><code>It’s an excellent book that will greatly improve your life.

You don’t have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.<br/> Here are some tips for preventing（阻止） weight gain and maintaining（维持） physical fitness:   <br/>Don’t skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack. This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.<br/> Control the amount of food. Use a small plate (about 10 inches) and put aside the large ones that may encourage you to \"load up\". You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist. <br/> Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables. Or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.<br/>Stick to physical activity. Don’t let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk help to burn off excess calories.<br/>Avoid(避免) high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat. Choose lean meat (瘦肉).Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.<br/>',5,2),(19,19,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Jack Brown，an office worker，lives in Washington．He inherited(继承)  a million dollars when he was 23，but he wasn’t happy at all．When his college friends were looking for their jobs，he didn’t have to．Jack decided to living a simple life like everyone else．He gave $l0,000 of his money to a charity(慈善机构)to help poor children live a better life．Today he is 36．He still wears cheap shoes and clothes and drives a small car only，but he is Very happy．<br/> Up to now Jack has helped some children from poor countries all over the world，by sending them each$200 a month．The money was used for the children’s study, food, medicine and clothing．Jack receives a report each year on the children’s progress(进步)．They can write to each other．but usually the children do not speak English．<br/>When Jack first heard about these children，he wanted to help them．“It was nothing special,” he said．“Until  I  went to these countries and met the children I was helping，I didn’t know anything about their life．” Once Jack went to meet a little girl in Africa．He said that the meeting was Very exciting．“When I met her．I felt very ,very happy．\"he said．“ I saw that the money was used for a good cause．It brought me happiness．I want to do everything I can to go on helping those children.”<br/>',5,2),(20,20,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Changsha,<br/>Hunan Province<br/>May 6, 2010<br/>Dear editor,<br/> Under China’s current educational system, there are those who do nothing but study. They of course are thought to be model students.<br/> But I feel that there is another type of student who, perhaps not as diligent (勤奋的) as the first type, uses his time more efficiently and achieves a lot academically.<br/> Last year, a classmate of mine was accepted by a top university. It surprised all of us. It was because, unlike most of us, he didn’t spend too much of his time studying.<br/> When I asked him the secret of his success, he said that the key was properly and scientifically arranging his time.<br/> “ I spent a lot of time keeping fit and as a result, I was able to better concentrate (集中) on my class work.”<br/>The moral of the story is: it isn’t necessary to sit at your desk all day long to get high academic (学术) grades.<br/>Yours,<br/>Zhang Zishu<br/>',5,2),(21,21,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                NEW YORK CITY?A hurricane warning has been given for New York City．Forecasters say Hurricane Irene could cause widespread flooding, power failure and billions of dollars in damage．About 65 million Americans live in Hurricane Irene’s projected path —many of whom have been <u>evacuated</u><u>．</u><br/>In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has ordered the city’s first-ever evacuation． Roughly 250,000 people have been told to leave their homes in low-lying areas, including the Wall Street financial district．<br/>WASHINGTON D．C．—On Aug．24, 2011, Apple announced that Mr．Steve Jobs, who has battled cancer for several years, was stepping down as the CEO but would serve as chairman．<br/>In January, he had announced that he was taking a medical leave of absence from Apple．In announcing his leave, he turned daily oversight of the company over to the chief operating officer, Timothy D．Cook, and it was Mr．Cook whom Apple named to succeed him as the next CEO of the company．<br/>TRIPOLI—Opposition forces in Libya say they control more than 90 percent of the country．It is still not clear where Moammar Gadhafi is．The opposition has offered more than 1,600,000 dollars for his capture （逮捕）．The head of the opposition forces said his group supports a decision by local businessmen to provide the money in an effort to speed up the capture．Earlier Wednesday, government forces fired onto the former headquarters （总部） of Mr．Gadhafi, which is now controlled by opposition forces．Heavy fighting also continued near Tripoli’s airport and in a town of Zuara．<br/>',5,2),(22,22,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                American middle school students don’t seem to care that they’re worse at maths than their counterparts (同龄人) in China’s Hong Kong and Finland. “I don’t need it,” my student says, “I’m going to be a basketball star.” Or a car mechanic, or a singer.<br/>Middle school students’ maths skills were tested by the International Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States ranked 28th out of 41 countries tested. After all, when was the last time you used algebra (代数)？<br/>But maths isn’t just about training Americans to become scientists. It has its own value. It helps you see patterns and develops your logic skills, and it teaches you to concentrate and to separate truth from falsehood. Maths helps you make wise financial decisions, so you can avoid false claims from advertisers, politicians and others. It helps you determine risk. For example, after an airplane crash, studies show that people are more likely to drive than to take a plane in spite of the fact that they are much more likely to be killed or injured while driving. Planes are not like criminals who repeat the same crime over and over. One plane is not more likely to crash just because another plane recently did. In fact, the most dangerous time to drive is probably right after a plane crash because so many people are on the road. <br/>It is not possible to really understand science and the scientific method without understanding maths. A rainbow is even more beautiful and amazing when we understand it.<br/>The precision (精确性) of maths helps us think in a very special way. How do we bring the learning of maths back to life? I don’t have the big answer. I try my best to help pupils find answers to some maths problems. When I can get one to say, “Wow, that’s great,” I feel the joy of a small victory.<br/>',5,2),(23,23,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Too many people want others to be their friends, but they don’t give friendship back. That is why some friendships do not last very long. To have a friend, you must learn to be one. You must learn to treat your friend the way you want your friend treat you. Learning to be a good friend means learning three rules. Be honest; be generous; be understanding.<br/>Honesty is where a good friendship starts. Friends must be able to trust one another. If you do not tell the truth, people usually find out. If a friend finds out that you haven’t been honest you may lose your friends’ trust. Good friends always count on one another to speak and act honestly.<br/><u>Generosity</u> means sharing and sharing makes a friendship grow. You do not have to give your lunch money on your clothes of course. Instead you have to learn how to share things you enjoy, like your hobbies and your interest. Naturally you will want to share your ideas and feelings. These can be very valuable to a friend. They tell your friend what is important to you. By sharing them you help your friend know you better.<br/>Sooner or later every one needs understanding and help with a problem. Something may go wrong at school. Talking about the problem can make it easier to solve. Turning to a friend can be a first step in solving the problem. So to be a friend you must listen and understand. You must try to put yourself in your friend’s place so you can understand the problem better. <br/>No two friendships are ever exactly alike. But all true friendships have three things in common. If you plan to keep your friends, you must practise honesty, generosity, and understanding.<br/>',5,2),(24,24,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Here are a few tips we’ve put together to help you learn English well.<br/>Speak, speak, speak<br/>Practise speaking as often as you can—even speaking to yourself is good practice.<br/>Try recording yourself whenever you can. Compare your pronunciation with the master version, see how you can do better and have another go. If you do this several times, you will find that each version is better than the last.<br/>Why not learn with someone else?<br/>It helps if you can learn with someone else. If you can persuade a friend or a family member to study with you, it will make you keep working.<br/>Don’t get stuck by a word you don’t know.<br/>Practise improvising（即兴的）ways of getting your meaning across when speaking spontaneously（本能地）, even if you don’t know the exact words or phrases. Think of things you might want to say whenever you have spare time. Use facial expressions, hand movements, anything to get your meaning across.<br/>Language learning is also about intuition（直觉）.<br/>Guesswork is an important way to learn a new language. When listening to recorded material, you aren’t expected to understand everything first round. If you play the same piece several times, you will most probably understand something new each time.<br/>Build up your vocabulary.<br/>A wide vocabulary is the key to successful language learning but don’t try to learn too much at once. It’s best to study frequently, for short periods of time. Take at most six or seven items of vocabulary and learn them. Put them into sentences to fix them in your mind, then come back to them later.<br/>And above all, have fun!<br/>',5,2),(25,25,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Parents should stop blaming themselves because there’s not a lot they can do about it. I mean the teenager problem. Whatever you do or however you choose to deal with it, at certain times a wonderful, reasonable and helpful child will turn into a terrible animal.<br/>I’ve seen friends deal with <u>it</u> in all kinds of different ways. One strict mother insisted that her son, right from a child, should stand up whenever anyone entered the room, open doors and shake hands like a gentleman. I saw him last week when I called round. Sprawling himself (懒散地躺) on the sofa in full length, he made no attempt to turn off the loud TV he was watching as I walked in, and his greeting was no more than a quick glance at me. His mother was ashamed. “I don\'t know what to do with him these days,” she said. “He’s forgotten all the manners we taught him.”<br/>He hasn’t forgotten them. He’s just decided that he’s not going to use them. She confessed (坦白) that she would like to come up behind him and throw him down from the sofa onto the floor.<br/>Another good friend of mine let her two daughters climb all over the furniture, reach across the table, stare at me and say, “I don’t like your dress; it’s ugly.” One of the daughters has recently been driven out of school. The other has left home.<br/>“Where did we go wrong?” her parents are now very sad. Probably nowhere much.

Its word-learning skills are as good as those of a parrot or chimpanzee.<br/>In one experiment, the researchers took all 200 items that Rico is supposed to know and divided them into 20 groups of 10 objects. Then the owner told the dog to go and fetch one of the items and bring it back. In four tests, Rico got 37 out of 40 commands right. As the dog couldn\'t see anyone to get clues, the scientists believe Rico must understand the meanings of certain words.<br/>In another experiment, the scientists took one toy that Rico had never seen before and put it in a room with seven toys whose names the dog already knew. The owner then told Rico to fetch the object, using a word the dog had never heard before.<br/>The correct object was chosen in seven out of ten tests, suggesting that the dog had worked<br/>out the answer by process of elimination(排除法). A month later, Rico remembered half of the new names, which is even more impressive. <br/>Rico is thought to be smarter than the average dog. For one thing, Rico is a border collie, a breed (品种)known for its m<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/5a/f0/5adf04558ff68f9cdb18d31b70697e2d.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>ental abilities. In addition, the 9-year-old dog has been trained to fetch toys by their names since the age of nine months.<br/>It\'s hard to know if all dogs understand at least some of the words we say. Even if they do, they can\'t talk back. Still, it wouldn\'t hurt to sweet-talk your dog every now and then.

But when movie stars began wearing their sunglasses in public, they quickly became a must.<br/>　 Eventually actors started wearing sunglasses in their movies as well as on the street. Audrey Hephburn wore ultra-cool Ray-Ban sunglasses in the 1961 movie, Breakfast at Tiffany’s. As a result, Ray-Ban sunglasses started to appear more and more in the movies. In 1979, Ray-Ban “Wayfarers” were worn by Jake and Elwood in The Blue Brothers. Tom Cruise wore Ray-Ban “Aviator” sunglasses in the 1986 hit, Top Gun. Then in 1997, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made Ray-Ban “Predator” sunglasses famous in Men in Black.<br/>　  Of course sunglasses aren’t just a fashion statement. The main reason to wear sunglasses is to protect our eyes against UV radiation. UV radiation can damage our eyes, so people now choose their sunglasses carefully.

Invited to speak to his old high school, he mentioned a valuable childhood experience: “Once, on a trip to the sea, my mother and I were lying on the beach. She pointed to the sea and said to me: ‘Do you see the seabirds fighting for food out there? When a wave comes near, the little birds rise quickly.

But our findings show that people believe their dreams provide meaningful insight (见识) into themselves and their world,” said a lead author of the study Carey More wedge, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. <br/> In six different studies, researchers surveyed nearly 1,100 people about their dreams. One of the studies focused on general beliefs about dreams and involved 149 university students. All students were asked to rate different theories about dreams. The experts found that a surprising majority of the participants supported the theory about dreams revealing (揭示) the hidden truths about themselves and the rest of the world. <br/> In a second experiment, they surveyed 182 people at a Boston train station, and asked them to imagine one out of four possible situations that could have occurred the night before a scheduled airline trip. Most of the participants said that dreaming of a plane crash would be more likely to affect their travel plans than would just thinking about a crash, or being warned by the government of a terrorism risk. They said a dreamed crash would influence their travel plans just as much as learning about a real crash on their planned route would.<br/> Another experiment involved 270 men and women from across the United States. In a short online survey, they were asked to recall one of the dreams they had seen about any person they knew. The findings showed that people were more likely to remember and describe pleasant dreams about a person they liked, rather than a person they disliked. Meanwhile, in most cases they tended to consider an unpleasant dream as more meaningful if it was about a person they disliked. <br/>“In other words,” said More wedge, “people attribute (归因于) meaning to dreams when it corresponds (与……一致) with their pre-existing beliefs and desires.” The researchers say that more investigation (研究) is needed to fully understand how people interpret their dreams. According to More wedge, most people realize that dreams are not predicting their fu<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/9e/4c/9e04c140f23cc09f99f4a169f7e6632b.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>ture, but they still try to find some meaning in there.<br/>',5,2),(42,42,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                A used book or nearly-new kitchen gadget (配件) may not be at the top of every Christmas wish list, but hard economic times coupled with a new green awareness are changing attitudes about gift-giving in France.<br/> French holiday shoppers are choosing larger numbers for “green” gifting this Christmas, studies show. About 30 percent of French consumers will give second-hand items as gifts to stretch out their tight budgets but also to do their little bit for recycling, according to a study by international consulting fi<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/07/9d/0789d383ad28952bc27b4aaaea1fcdcd.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>rm Deloitte.<br/> The survey of Christmas consumer behaviors in 18 European countries found the French were more than twice as likely as other Europeans to give second-hand items. Websites promoting re-gifting and green gifting are popular in France, with many reporting a rise in business.<br/>“Concerns about the ecology and the economy have come together and we are now seeing people who accept the types of gifts that were not appreciated just a short time ago,” said Sebastien Ravut, who runs a website promoting eco-friendly consumerism. His site lists shops in France that offer fair trade products, bio-friendly goods and recycled items. Over the Christmas holidays, the number of visits to the site has doubled from last year, reaching 60,000 a month.<br/> A study by online survey firm Vivodi for PriceMinister showed eight out of 10 people would be happy to receive a used item as a gift and that younger consumers were more open to the idea.<br/> But Gilles Goldenberg, author of the Deloitte study, said that environmental concerns are not why customers buy used goods. “The number one c<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/ca/9a/ca59a378c2402e49ade17c032d1d287a.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>oncern is getting the lowest possible price,” said Goldenberg. “Eco-friendly products are drawing a lot of interest, but not if that means paying more.”<br/> Theatre tickets and other low-carbon gifts are fashionable, and eco-friendly websites<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/ca/9a/ca59a378c2402e49ade17c032d1d287a.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/> are also encouraging gift givers to offer time and services instead of stuff. “The order of the day is to spend less time shopping and more time connecting” over the holidays, said Florence de Monclin from the Nicolas Helot foundation for Nature and Humanity.<br/>',5,2),(43,43,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Though war is something people hate, Director Feng Xiaoning often exposes his audien<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/dd/8f/ddb8f2f3c0fdd920730dbd777d9fb13e.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>ce to it.<br/>“If we don’t impress the audience, who are without the painful experience of war, with the cruel injury to life and human nature war causes, how can we bring them a love of peace and objection to war?” asked the director with a glance in his eyes.<br/>After Red River Valley and Lover’s Grief over the Yellow River, both of which star Chinese model and actress Ning Jing, Feng drew a satisfactory full stop to his war trilogy (三部曲) last month with Purple Sunset.<br/>The film tells a story which took place in 1945, at the very moment when World War II was drawing to an end.

This humanity, the longing for peace and eagerness to survive, make the three unite.<br/>“If people are touched by justice, tolerance and unselfishness, I think I have achieved my goal,” Feng said. Feng admits that there are violent and bloody scenes in the film, such as tanks fighting and Japanese burning Chinese people alive, to show the cruelty of the war. But that’s never his personal preference, he says.<br/>“Everyone who has watched my films can tell how much I hate war,” he said. “I wrote all the things for my war films by myself. Whenever I finished one, I felt as though I had suffered great pain.”<br/>Feng regards every one of his productions as an opportunity to learn about human nature and humanity.

By working through each 10-minute lesson, you\'ll learn what you need to begin to use the PHP scripting language to make your websites interactive and dynamic.<br/>REVIEW<br/>When I first laid eyes on this book and its title, Teach Yourself PHP in 10 minutes, my first thought was that I was going to see this!  So I opened it up and figured I\'d look through it for ten minutes and see what would hit me. Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk.<br/>Not only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics.

It is a little smaller than China. It is in the south of the earth. Australia is big, but its population is small. The population of Australia is nearly as large as that of Shanghai.<br/> Enough laws have been made to fight against pollution. The cities in Australia have got little air or water pollution. The sky is blue and the water is clean. You can clearly see fish swimming in the rivers. Plants grow very well.<br/>Last month we visited Perth, the biggest city in Western Australia, and went to a wild flowers\' exhibition (展览).There we saw a large number of wild flowers we had never seen before. We had a wonderful time. Perth is famous for its beautiful wild flowers. In spring every year Perth has the wild flowers\' exhibition. After visiting Perth, we spent a day in the countryside. We sat down and had a rest near a path at the foot of a hill. It was quiet and we enjoyed ourselves. <br/>Suddenly we heard bells ringing at the top of the hill. What we saw made us pick up all our things and run back to the car as quickly as we could. There were about three hundred sheep coming towards us down the path.<br/> Australia is famous for its sheep and kangaroos.

At this point, it is good to ask yourself a bunch of critical questions. Are you at the point in your career where you want to be ? Have you so far accomplished all o<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/79/53/7965388f873af182d6c4387fa8070482.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>f your goals in life ? If so, then maybe it is time to make goals that stretch yourself a bit more. If you have not accomplished your goals in life, then perhaps you have made the mistake of setting too many goals or trying to accomplish them at an unnaturally fast pace.<br/> It is necessary to set reasonable, intelligent goals in order to succeed in life. Do not be unrealistic because <u>life is not a fairy tale</u>. But you should try to recognize what you want, and to be as specific as possible when attempting to visualize（形象化） or otherwise express what your goals in life are. <br/> In order for a goal to sufficiently motivate you, it needs to be a major one. The bigger your goals are, then the more motivated you will need to be to work towards accomplishing them. If you want, for example, to be the greatest concert pianist, in the world, then you are going to find yourself a lot more motivated than you would be if your goal were merely to, say, play a couple of Beethoven pieces extremely well. If you are a beginner, then no doubt mastering those tough songs is a very intelligent and realistic goal to set. But if that is your only goal as a pianist, then you will stop growing as a pianist once that goal has been achieved. This is why it is necessary to constantly stop and re-evaluate our goals so that we are aware of what they are, and thus stay motivated.<br/>',5,2),(55,55,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                It was a dark and cold night.

So he quickly opened the door of the car and asked, “Where do you want to go, sir?”<br/>“To the Star Hotel,” the young man answered. When the car driver heard that, he didn’t feel happy. The young man would give him only three dollars because the hotel was not far from the railway station. But suddenly, he had an idea. He took the passenger through many streets of the big city.<br/>After a long time, the car finally arrived at the hotel. “You should pay me fifteen dollars,” the car driver said to the young man. “What! Fifteen dollars? Do you think I’m a fool? Only last week I took a car from the railway station to this same hotel and I only gave the driver thirteen dollars.

Develop strong personal reasons as well as your health and responsibility to others. For example, think of all the time you waste taking cigarette breaks, rushing out to buy a pack, hunting a light, etc. Set a date for quitting --- perhaps a special day like your birthday, a holiday.

Of course, it is possible. You can communicate your moods and intentions to one another without words, because all human beings share a lot of common visual（看见的）signals. These signals are as effective as words during communication.<br/>The gestures of the head play a key role in body language. The movements of eyes and eyebrows are as important as head movements in body language.<br/>　　Besides the gestures of the head or the movements of the eyes and eyebrows, the action of arms, hands and legs is also a large part of body language. Extending one\'s arm and shaking hands with others is a greeting in both formal and informal cases. This part of body language might date back to primary tribes（部落）.<br/>　　Like handshaking, there are still many other forms of body language presented by hands. Raising one\'s hand and making a circle with his thumb（拇指）and for finger signals, that something is OK.

The following ways might help improve their ability.<br/> First of all, do things step by step. It is not good to listen to something beyond your level. Better choose a suitable course and start with the first book. Go on to the second book only after you are sure you understand the first one.<br/> Secondly, stick to one course of study. Don’t change books often. Never let your attention be attracted by another course just because it seems to be more “ fashionable”(时髦). <br/> Thirdly, listen to the English news programme over the radio from time to time. Better go through the news stories in the Chinese-language newspaper first. That will make it easy for you to understand the English news on the radio.<br/> Fourthly, if you have time, listen to some interesting stories in “special English” from the VOA or other listening materials of the same level as that of your textbook.<br/>',5,2),(61,61,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Move Earth — it’s no science fiction<br/>LONDON — Scientists have found an unusual way to prevent our planet from overheating: move it to a cooler spot. All you have to do is send a few comets（彗星）in the direction of Earth, and its orbit will be changed. Our world will then be sent spinning into a safer, colder part of the solar system.<br/>This idea for improving our climate comes from a group of US National Aeronautics and Space Administration（NASA） engineers and American astronomers. They say their plan could add another six billion years to the useful lifetime of our planet—effectively doubling its working life.<br/>The plan put forward by Dr Laughlin, and his colleagues Don Korycansky and Fred Adams ,needs carefully directing a comet or asteroid so that it passes close by our planet and sends some of its gravitational energy to Earth.<br/>“Earth’s orbital speed would increase as a result and we would move to a higher orbit away from the Sun,” Laughlin said.<br/>Engineers would then direct their comet so that it passed close to Jupiter or Saturn. The comet would pick up energy from one of these giant planets. Later its orbit would bring it back to Earth, and the process would be repeated. In the short term, the plan provides an ideal way to global warming, although the team was actually concerned with a much greater danger. The sun is certain to heat up in about a billion years and so “seriously compromise” our biosphere（生物圈）— by cooking us.<br/>That’s why the group decided to try to save Earth.<br/>The plan has one or two worrying aspects, however. For a start, space engineers would have to be very careful about how they directed their asteroid or comet towards Earth. The smallest miscalculation（误算）in orbit could fire it straight at Earth—with deadly consequences.<br/>There is also the question of the Moon. As the current issue of Scientific American magazine points out, if Earth was pushed out of its current position it is “most likely the Moon would be stripped away from Earth,” it states. This would greatly change our planet’s climate.<br/>',5,2),(62,62,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Man has a big brain. He can think, learn and speak.

They make noises when they are afraid, or angry or unhappy. Apes(猿) can understand some things more quickly than human, one or two of them have learnt a few words. But they can not join words to make sentences. They can not think like us because they have no language. Language is a wonderful thing. Man has been able to build a modern world because he has language. Every child can speak his own language very well when he is four or five, —but no animal learns to speak. How do children learn it ?

This letter is written to ask for your opinion.<br/> The other day, I met with a multiple - choice exercise. We teachers argued heatedly with each other over its answer. Unfortunately, neither side could convince the other. The sentence is to be attached at the end of the letter. There is no doubt that the reference answer C is correct. But I don’t  think it is the only answer. Personally, I do think A is also a reasonable choice in sense as well as in grammar, if the case is treated from another aspect.                                <br/> What puzzles me is why we should deal with so many multiple - choice exercises with not rigorous（严谨的）enough reference keys. But being a teacher, it’s very important and necessary to make it clear to students which answer is correct, which is more appropriate, and which is the best one. Regrettably, Multiple - choice test, which is a bit old - fashioned in western countries, seems to be quite popular and covers a rather high percentage in all sorts of English tests in China, especially in NMET.<br/> Personally speaking, I don’t think multiple - choice test form making up more than 75 percent of the total scores in college entrance examination is a very good and effective testing method. Instead, more subjective testing forms depending on one’s own thinking and his ability to use the language like key words falling, question answering, paragraph or passage summarizing, English - Chinese or Chinese - English inter - translation, etc. should be applied to English proficiency tests. Through the test forms mentioned above, students’ ability to use the language will be better developed. Consequently, more advanced and outstanding English learners could be picked out. In fact, a test paper focusing on multiple - choice test influences, in a sense, students to form their own language thinking, which hinders（阻碍）the development of their language ability as well.

The authorities are doing their best to arise the public awareness of the vital importance of the environmental protection. This issue is, indeed, worth following up.<br/> Environmental protection is closely related not only to our personal life, but also to the entire human race and the world’s further development. For one thing, the environment, in a narrow sense, determines the quality of<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/32/1d/3221daca79c08f07f1dc65585941497c.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/> our individual life. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, etc. , all come directly from the environment. If they continue to be contaminated, we may have neither clean water, nor healthy food. For another thing, in a broader sense, the environment plays a decisive role in fate of mankind. As is known to all, the earth, up to now, is human being’s only dwelling place. We can expect that some day we will live on another planet, but I doubt that this day will come earlier than the day when the earth becomes a globe of waste, if we keep damaging the environment. Finally, the environment is essential to the further development of the world. Extensive industrialization, which has brought about all the convenience and facilities we enjoy today, has been depending on the comprehensive exploitation of the earth’s natural resources found in the environment. If we do not protect the environment properly, further development cannot be guaranteed. In a word, to protect the environment is an urgent task.<br/> Nevertheless, environmental protection is indeed a de<img src=\"https://tiku.21cnjy.com/tikupic/32/1d/3221daca79c08f07f1dc65585941497c.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"/>manding task. Many people are still, either unconscious of the urgency of the task or deliberately damaging the environment for the interests of their own. Hence, we should adopt severe measures to prohibit people from doing more harms to the environment. Meanwhile, we need to make the gravity of the present situation known to all. In other words, punishment and instruction should be equally emphasized. Only in this way can we look forward to a cleaner and greener world.<br/>',5,2),(68,68,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                If you want to keep healthy, you should have good habits. What is a habit? It is something we do very often. We don’t even think when we do it. It has become a part of our lives.<br/>“Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.” This is an old English saying. Do you know what it means? It means that we must go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy, rich and clever.<br/>Is this true? Perhaps it is. We know the body must have enough sleep. Boys and girls need eight or nine hours’ sleep every day.<br/>Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is a very bad habit. Then you will not think or do your work well. Of course, you can’t be healthy, wealthy or wise.<br/>When we get up early in the morning, we can go out and do morning exercises. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running jumping, swimming, and playing ball games are all exercise. If we don’t exercise, our body will become weak.<br/>Exercise helps the blood (血液) to move around inside our body. Blood takes food to all parts of our body.<br/>Our body also needs air to breathe. Without air, we will die. We must have lots of clean fresh air if we want to be healthy. That is why many people like to go out to do morning exercise.<br/>',5,2),(69,69,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                When you want to go shopping, you’d better decide how much money you can spend on new clothes. <br/>Think about the kind of clothes you really need. Then look for those clothes you really need. Then look for those clothes on sale.<br/>There are labels(标签) inside all new clothes. The labels tell you how to take care of your clothes. The label for a shirt may tell you to wash it in warm water. A sweater label may tell you to wash in cold water. The label on a coat may say “dry clean only”, for washing may ruin this coat. If you do as the directions(说明) on the label, you can keep your clothes looking their best for a long time.<br/>Many clothes today must be dry cleaned. Dry cleaning is expensive. When buying new clothes, check to see if they will need to be dry cleaned. You will save money if you buy clothes that can be washed.<br/>You can save money if you buy clothes that are well done. Well-made clothes last longer. They look good even after they have been washed many times. Clothes that cost more money are not necessarily(不一定) better made. They do not always fit better. Sometimes less expensive clothes look and fit better than more expensive clothes.<br/>',5,2),(70,70,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Our surrounding(周围) is being polluted faster than nature and man’s present efforts can’t prevent it. Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials.<br/> What can explain and solve this problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man—by his desire for a modern way of life. We make “increasing industrialization” our chief aim. So we are always ready to offer everything: clean air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. There is a constant flow of people from countryside to cities, eager for the benefit of our modern society. But as our technological achievements have grown in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem.<br/> Isn’t it time we stopped to ask ourselves where we are going—and why? It makes one think of the story about the airline pilot who told his passengers over the loudspeaker, “I’ve some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we’re making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour.

During one of these trips, he was sitting in a train when a strange man came up to him. The stranger looked at the tall clumsy(笨拙的)lawyer and said that he had something he believed belonging to Lincoln. Lincoln was a bit puzzled. He had never seen the man before. He didn’t see how a total stranger could have something of his. Lincoln asked how this could be. The stranger pulled out a penknife and began to explain. Many years before, he had been given the pocketknife. He had been told to keep it until he was able to find a man uglier than himself. <br/>Lincoln’s eyes always <u>sparked</u> when he reached this part of the story.

The dry bean seeds contain a store of nutrients just waiting to be released when they sprout. Under the right conditions they will germinate (发芽)。 As they grow, the food value of the seeds is multiplied into vitamins, minerals (矿物质) and other nutrients. This happens almost overnight!<br/> It is easy to grow your own sprouts, but you need to buy your seeds from supermarkets or health food stores. Seeds for planting in the garden are often powdered with chemicals, so when becoming sprouts they are not safe to eat.<br/> Try growing sprouts from a variety of beans and seeds. You will find different sprouts at different stages. Bean sprouts are best when they are about three centimeters long. Wheat and sunflower sprouts taste best when the sprouts and the seeds are of the same length. If the sunflower sprout is too long it leaves a funny stinging feeling in the throat after eating. Alfalfa sprouts are best when their small leaves are well developed. Pea and soybean sprouts are good long or short. <br/> If you leave your sprouts in filtered sunlight for a few hours, the leaves will turn green as chlorophyll (叶绿素) is added.

Why have you been selling insurance only to people over 95 years old, and why have you been giving them such generous（宽厚的）conditions? You’ll ruin our company if you go on like that.”<br/> “Oh, no, sir,” answered Mr. Briggs at once, “Before I started work, I looked at the figures(数字) for deaths in this country during the past ten years, and I can tell you that few people die at the age of 95.”<br/>',5,2),(77,77,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                To become a doctor in the United States, students usually attend four years of medical school after they complete college.

They work under the supervision(管理) of medical professors and more experienced doctors. Medical residents treat patients . they carry out tests. They perform operations. They complete records. In hospitals with few nurses, residents also do work formerly done by nurses. Some medical residents work one-hundred or more hours in a single week. <u>They often work for more than thirty-six hours at a time before they can rest.</u><br/>Critics (批评家) of this system say medical residents work too long and do not get enough res. They say these young doctors may be too tired to perform their medical duties effectively. Now, the government will limit the number of hours of work that residents can work. Most doctors in training will be limited to eighty-four hours of work each week. They will have work periods of no more than twenty-four hours at one time. They will have ten hours of rest between work periods.<br/>Medical residents will have one day each week when they do not have to work. Any work they accept outside their hospitals will be limited．Experienced doctors and medical professors will closely supervise the residents to make sure they are not too tired to work.<br/>Many medical residents welcomed the work limits.

In some countries, if you give a big burp, you are told to say “Excuse me, please”.<br/>In many places people like to eat together. But in some parts of Polynesia it is bad manners to be seen eating at all. People show their good manners by turning their backs on others while they eat.<br/>What are manners like in an East African town? The people try not to see you. They are being polite. You may see a friend. He may not see you at all. If you are polite, you will sit down beside him. You will wait until he finishes what he is doing. Then he will talk to you.

However, we do know a lot about languages, the languages of today and also the languages of earlier times. There are probably about 3,000 languages in the world today. Chinese is the language with the most speakers. English, Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people. On the other hand, some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers.<br/>There are several important families of languages in the world. For example, most of the languages of Europe are in one large family called Indo-European. The original (最初的) language of this family was spoken about 4,500 years ago. Many of the present day languages of Europe and India are modern forms of the language of 4,500 yeas ago.<br/>Languages are always changing. The English of today is very different from the English of 500 years ago. In time some even died out completely. About 1,000 years ago, English was a little-known relative of German spoken on one of the borders of Europe. <br/>If a language has a large number of speakers or if it is very old, there may be differences in the way it is spoken in different areas. That is, the language may have several dialects. Chinese is a good example of <i><u>dialect</u></i> differences. Chinese has been spoken for thousands of years by many millions of speakers. The differences between the dialects of Chinese are so great that speakers of Chinese from some parts of China can’t understand speakers from other parts.<br/>',5,2),(82,82,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Ask any person who is successful in whatever he or she is doing what motivates him/her, and very likely the answer will be \"goals\". Goal Setting is extremely important to motivation and success. So what motivates you? Why are you in college? If you are in college because that\'s what your parents want, you may find it difficult to motivate yourself. Sure, it\'s possible to succeed with someone else providing the motivation for you. (\"If you graduate from college, I\'ll give you a car!\" or worse \"If you don\'t graduate from college, you won\'t get a car.\") But motivation that comes from within really makes the difference. <br/>Certainly, you need some intelligence, knowledge base, study skills, and time management skills, but if you don\'t have motivation, you won\'t get far. Think about this analogy. You have a car with a full tank of gas, a well-tuned engine, good set of tires, quadraphonic CD system, and a sleek, polished exterior(外表). There it sits. This car has incredible potential. However, until a driver sits behind the wheel, puts the key in the ignition(点火装置), and cranks it up, the car doesn\'t function. You guessed it; the KEY is MOTIVATION. <br/>Interest is an important motivator for a student. So is a desire to learn. When you link these two things together, you create success. Often success in an endeavor(努力) leads to more interest and a greater desire to learn, creating an upward spiral(螺旋形) of motivation toward a goal you have established. <br/>So be honest with yourself. Are you genuinely interested in being in college? Have you set realistic goals for yourself? How can you develop the internal motivation that really counts? When it comes to motivation, KNOWING is not as important as DOING. <br/>',5,2),(83,83,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Most young architects ----particularly those in big cities ----can only dream about working in a building of their own. And marking that dream come true often means finding a building no one else seems to want, which is exactly what happened to David Yocum and his partner, Brain Bell. Their building is a former automobile electrical –parts firm in Atlanta. Form the outside, it looks too old, even something horrible, but open the door and you are in a wide, open courtyard, lined on three sides with rusting(生锈的) walls.<br/>In 2000, Yocum and Bell found this building in the city’s West End. Built in 1947, the structure had been abandoned years earlier and the roof of the main building had fallen down. But the price was right, so Yocum bought it. He spent eight months of his off-hours on demolition(拆除), pulling rubbish out through the roof, because it was too dangerous to go inside the building, The demolition was hard work, but it gave him time to think about what he wanted to do, and “to treasure what was there – the walls, the rust, the light,” Yocum said.” Every season, more paint falls off the walls and more rust develops. It’s like an art installation(装置) in there-a slow-motion show.”<br/>Since the back building had been constructed without windows, an all-glass front was added to the building to give it a view of the courtyard, and skylights were installed in the roof. The back of the building is a working area and a living room for Yocum and his wife. A sort of buffer(缓冲) zone between the front and the back contains a bathroom, a kitchen and a mechanical room, and the walls that separate these zones have openings that allow views through to the front of the studio and the courtyard beyond.<br/>Yocum and Bell, who have just completed an art gallery for the city, feel that the experience from decoration of their building, focusing on the inside rather than the outside, has influenced their work. It has also given these architects a chance to show how they can make more out of less.<br/>',5,2),(84,84,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                  She is only 12 years old but lives only with her younger sister. Her parents are far away from home, and she has to take care of her younger sister. She is He Can, a student at Anqing Jiangzhen Middle School in Anhui, one of the “stay-at-home children” in her town. To make money, these kids’ parents go to big cities to find jobs. Their children have to stay at home because they have to go to school.    <br/> He Can’s parents left home when she was only four. They only come back for the Spring Festival every year. Because she had to live with different relatives at different times, He Can went to eight different primary schools.    <br/> “I used to complain,” she said. “But later I understood my parents. They have to go away to make a better life for us.” He Can said her frequently (频繁地) changing life also has a good side.    <br/> “When I went to a new school, I had to try to make friends,” said He Can. “I became outgoing. Now I’m not afraid of talking to people.”    <br/> He Can said her relatives were kind to her. They taught her how to cook and wash clothes.     <br/> When He Can was going to start junior high school, her parents agreed to let her live out with her younger sister. She rents a house near the school. Sometimes their grandmother comes over and helps them.    <br/> Every day, He Can gets up at 6:00 am and cooks breakfast. Then the two girls go to school. They have supper at 6:00 pm. Then He Can does chores and helps her sister take a shower. She usually goes to bed at 9:30 pm.    <br/> Though busy, He Can is still a top student in her class. She said the secret is never to put things off until tomorrow.    <br/> “I think my life is OK,” she said. “But if possible, I would like my parents to settle down (安顿下来) and live with us.”<br/>',5,2),(85,85,'<!--<br<li><!--<br />-->                Chinese are very generous (慷慨) when it comes to educating their children. Not caring about the money, parents often send their children to the best schools or even abroad to England, the United States or Australia. They also want their children to take extra-course activities where they will either learn a musical instrument or ballet（芭蕾舞）, or other classes that will give them a head start in life. The Chinese believe that the more expensive an education is, the better it is. So parents will spend an unreasonable amount of money on education. Even poor couples will buy a computer for their son or daughter.<br/> However, what most parents fail to see is that the best early education they can give their children is usually very cheap.<br/> Parents can see that their children’s skills vary, skilled in some areas while poor in others. What most parents fail to realize though, is that today’s children lack self-respect and self-confidence (自信). <br/> The problem is that parents are only educating their children on how to take multiple-choice tests and how to study well, but parents are not teaching them the most important skills they need to be confident, happy and clever.<br/> Parents can achieve this by teaching practical skills like cooking, sewing and doing other housework.<br/> Teaching a child to cook will improve many of the skills that he will need later in life. Cooking demands patience and time. It is an enjoyable but difficult experience. A good cook always tries to improve his cooking, so he will learn to work hard and gradually finish his job successfully. His result, a well-cooked dinner, will give him much satisfaction and a lot of self-confidence.<br/> Some old machines, such as a broken radio or TV set that you give your child to play with will make him curious and arouse（唤起） his interest. He will spend hours looking at them, trying to fix them; your child might become an engineer when he grows up. These activities are not only teaching a child to read a book, but rather to think, to use his mind. And that is more important.  <br/>',5,2);
